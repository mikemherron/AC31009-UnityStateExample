## AC31009 Week 10 - The State Design Pattern - Unity Example
This the small sample project used in the Week 10 seminar on The State Design Pattern. 

The `main` branch contains the initial version of the charge and dash mechanic in PlayerController. In the `refactor-states-1` branch, the code has been refactored to use a `State` enum. In the `refactor-states-2` branch, the code has been further refactored to extract states in to individual classes implementing a common interface, thus implementing the State pattern. See the weekly seminar slides for the relevant diagrams.
